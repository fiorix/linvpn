linvpn installation
===================

    Compiling

The `configure' shellscript will attempt to generate a Makefile for you.

To compile linvpn you need libgcrypt headers installed on the system: 
http://directory.fsf.org/security/libgcrypt.html.

If you're using *BSD I recommend you to use `gmake' instead of `make'.

Basically, the process that well known sequence:

$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install

If your system doesn't follow standard /usr/include and /usr/lib 
directories you MUST specify it by using CFLAGS and LDFLAGS, as follows:

$ CFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install

The `PREFIX' for the installation is /usr, so binary files will be in
/usr/sbin and manpages in /usr/share/man. The configuration file won't
be installed by default, so you have to copy it from doc/ to /etc.

See README for more information.
